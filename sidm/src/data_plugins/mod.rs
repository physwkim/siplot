//! Data plugins — the protocol backends behind `protocol://address` channels.
//!
//! Mirrors `pydm/data_plugins/`. A [`DataPlugin`] owns the logic for one
//! protocol (`loc`, `fake`, `ca`, `pva`, `calc`). The engine creates a
//! connection (shared state + write queue + cancellation token) and hands the
//! plugin a [`ConnectionCtx`]; the plugin spawns a task on the supplied runtime
//! handle that publishes [`crate::ChannelState`] updates through
//! [`crate::channel::StateWriter`] and consumes queued writes.
