# siplot 3D — `silx.gui.plot3d` parity roadmap

Tracking doc for the port of silx's true-3D scene subsystem
(`silx.gui.plot3d`, ~26k lines / 64 files of OpenGL scene-graph code) onto
siplot's wgpu/egui infrastructure. This is a sibling effort to the 2D
`doc/parity-roadmap.md` (which covers `silx.gui.plot`); the 2D roadmap's scope
line deliberately excluded plot3d, and this doc owns it.

Reference source (consulted, never guessed): `~/codes/silx/src/silx/gui/plot3d/`.

## Scope decision

Full parity target (user sign-off 2026-06-15): port the whole `plot3d` stack —
scene foundation, every 3D item, the `ScalarFieldView` flagship (isosurface +
cut plane), and the surrounding tools/window. Built wave by wave; each wave is
gated (fmt/clippy/nextest per touched crate) and committed one feature at a
time, mirroring the 2D port's cadence.

### N/A (siplot-specific deviations, like the 2D OpenGL/Matplotlib backend split)

- **The Pygfx alternate backend (`*Pygfx` classes).** siplot has one GPU
  backend (wgpu); silx's OpenGL/Pygfx duality has no analogue here.
- **Qt `ParamTreeView` / `_model.py` tree model.** Replaced by an egui
  immediate-mode parameter panel (no retained Qt item model).
- **`QGLWidget`/`OpenGLWidget` plumbing.** Replaced by the egui-wgpu
  `CallbackTrait` offscreen-render-then-blit path (see architecture below).

## Architecture (how 3D lands inside egui-wgpu)

egui's paint render pass is **color-only (no depth attachment)**, so depth-tested
3D cannot draw straight into it. The faithful path mirrors the existing
`ClearCallback`/`ImageCallback` pattern but renders offscreen first:

- A `Scene3dCallback: egui_wgpu::CallbackTrait`:
  - `prepare()` — size an offscreen **color + depth** texture pair to the
    widget's pixel rect, write camera/scene uniforms, and encode a depth-tested
    render pass (clear → draw all 3D primitives) into the offscreen color target.
  - `paint()` — blit the offscreen color texture into egui's pass as a
    viewport-clipped fullscreen triangle.
- Persistent GPU state lives in the same `callback_resources` type-map as the 2D
  renderer, keyed by a scene id.
- **Depth convention:** silx targets OpenGL clip-space z∈[-1,1]; wgpu is z∈[0,1].
  silx's projection matrices are ported verbatim (parity + testability) and a
  fixed [-1,1]→[0,1] clip-correction is applied only at the GPU upload boundary.
- **Matrix storage:** silx numpy matrices are row-major and applied as `M·v`;
  Rust `Mat4` mirrors that row-major layout (line-for-line port, unit-tested
  against silx values) and transposes to column-major only at GPU upload (WGSL
  `mat4x4` is column-major).

## Phases / waves

Legend: ✅ done · ◐ partial · ☐ not started

### Phase 0 — scene foundation (everything depends on it)

| Wave | Item | silx source | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0.1 | `Mat4`/`Vec3` + camera math (look-at, perspective, ortho, rotate, orbit, resetCamera) | scene/transform.py, scene/camera.py | ✅ |
| P0.2 | wgpu line/triangle pipeline + offscreen depth render + blit callback | (siplot infra) | ✅ |
| P0.3 | `SceneWidget` + orbit/pan/zoom interaction + bounding box + axes | scene/interaction.py, primitives.py (Lines/Box/Axes/BoxWithAxes), viewport.py, SceneWidget.py | ✅ |

### Phase 1 — basic 3D items

| Wave | Item | silx source | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1.1 | Scatter3D (points / spheres) | items/scatter.py, primitives Points/ColorPoints/Spheres | ✅ |
| P1.2 | Mesh / Box / Cylinder / Hexagon | items/mesh.py, primitives Mesh3D/ColormapMesh3D + Geometry | ✅ |
| P1.3 | 3D ImageData / ImageRgba / HeightMap | items/image.py, items/_pick.py, primitives ImageData/ImageRgba | ✅ |

P1.1 notes: `Scatter3D` ports silx's `Points`/`_Points` faithfully — billboarded,
pixel-sized markers (all eight `_Points` symbols) via `scene3d_points.wgsl`.
Documented simplifications: colour is mapped through the colormap on the CPU
(`Colormap::color_at`) at geometry-build time rather than in a GPU colormap
texture (points are few vs image rasters); per-point picking (`_pickFull`) is
deferred with the rest of GPU picking (see Architecture); the `Spheres` primitive
(shaded 3D spheres — not used by silx `Scatter3D`, which renders `Points`) is not
yet ported.

P1.3 notes: `ImageData3D`/`ImageRgba3D` render a 2D image as one textured quad
(`scene3d_image.wgsl` + `Scene3dImageLayer`, an `Rgba8Unorm` texture per layer),
matching silx's single-quad-per-image approach (not per-pixel geometry); image
colour is premultiplied-linear so it round-trips the blit, with nearest/linear
`InterpolationMixIn`. `ImageData3D` colormaps on the CPU (as P1.1/P1.2);
`ImageRgba3D` takes `Color32` pixels directly. `HeightMapData`/`HeightMapRGBA`
render the height field as size-1 square points — exactly how silx renders them
(`primitives.Points`, marker `'s'`) — reusing the point pipeline; mismatched
colour/height sizes are nearest-neighbour resampled. Documented divergence: silx's
resample indexes the column axis by the field *height* (image.py:318/390, a bug on
non-square data); this port uses *width* (agrees for equal-sized data). Image
`_pickFull` (plane intersect / NDC point picking) deferred with GPU picking.

P1.2 notes: a `scene3d_mesh.wgsl` pipeline shades lit triangles with silx's
camera-fixed headlight (`DirectionalLight` defaults: ambient 0.3, diffuse 0.7, no
specular), computed per-frame on the GPU from the view-transformed normal. Items
in `render::scene3d_items`: `Mesh3D` (uniform/per-vertex colour) and
`ColormapMesh3D` (per-vertex scalar through a `Colormap`, CPU `color_at` as
Scatter3D), both supporting `triangles`/`triangle_strip`/`fan` modes + optional
indices via a single `expand_triangles` owner (strips/fans expand to a triangle
list, since the GPU path is `TriangleList` only) and a flat-normal fallback when
no normals are given. `Box3D`/`Cylinder3D`/`Hexagon3D` port
`_CylindricalVolume`: faceted Box (4 faces) / Hexagon (6), smooth radial-normal
Cylinder (nb_faces), one or many instances per call. Documented simplifications:
colormap on CPU (as P1.1); mesh `_pickFull` deferred with GPU picking; lighting
params are silx's viewport defaults baked in (a lighting on/off + parameter API is
a later enhancement).

### Phase 2 — `ScalarFieldView` flagship

| Wave | Item | silx source | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| P2.1 | Marching-cubes isosurface + ScalarField3D | items/volume.py, silx.math.marchingcubes | ✅ |
| P2.2 | Cut planes + colormap | scene/cutplane.py, primitives PlaneInGroup/ClipPlane | ✅ |
| P2.3 | ScalarFieldView widget + ComplexField3D | ScalarFieldView.py, items/volume.py | ✅ |

P2.3 notes: shipped in three waves. **P2.3a** closed a latent `SceneWidget` bug —
`upload` forwarded only the lines/triangles channels, silently dropping
points/meshes/images/textured-meshes — by adding `Scene3dGeometry::extend_from`
(`render::gpu_scene3d`), the single owner that merges all six channels; the widget
now appends every data-item channel beneath the chrome. **P2.3b** ports silx
`items.volume.ComplexField3D`: a complex field `(re, im)` projected to a real
scalar through a `ComplexMode` feeding an inner `ScalarField3D`. The shared
`ComplexMixIn.ComplexMode` enum (silx puts it on the base shared by the 2D
`ImageComplexData` and 3D `ComplexField3D`) was relocated from
`widget::complex_image_view` to `core::complex` so 2D + 3D share one enum without
inverting the `core → render → widget` layering; `set_complex_mode` clears the
iso-surfaces and keeps the cut plane (silx `setComplexMode`), the two
amplitude-phase composites have no scalar (`to_scalar → 0.0`). **P2.3c** ports the
`ScalarFieldView` flagship widget (`src/widget/scalar_field_view.rs`): it owns one
`ScalarField3D` (iso-surfaces + a cut plane) rendered through a `SceneWidget`,
mirroring silx — `set_data` frames the camera to the volume box only on the
**first** data (silx `centerScene`-once; subsequent updates keep the viewpoint via
the new `SceneWidget::set_bounds_keep_view`), with `add_isosurface` /
`add_auto_isosurface` / `remove_isosurface` / `clear_isosurfaces` mapping 1:1 to
silx, the cut plane configured via `field_mut` + `rebuild`. Geometry is uploaded
eagerly on data-layer change (not per frame), matching `SceneWidget`. **Deferred
(documented):** the `setComplexMode`/iso-surface re-resolve UI panel and 3D
picking remain with the Phase 3 tools and the standing GPU-picking deferral.

P2.2 notes: the plane math (`src/core/scene3d/plane.rs`) ports silx
`scene.utils.Plane` + the box/segment intersection helpers (`boxPlaneIntersect`,
`segmentPlaneIntersect`, `angleBetweenVectors`). The GPU side generalises the
P1.3 image quad into `Scene3dTexturedMesh` (`render::gpu_scene3d`) — an
arbitrary world-space triangle list sampling one texture through the same
premultiplied-alpha `image_pipeline` (a shared `build_image_texture_bind_group`
owner; quads and meshes collect into one draw list keyed by `vertex_count`).
`CutPlane` (`render::scene3d_items`) ports silx `items.volume.CutPlane`: a
config item (plane + colormap + interpolation + resolution + visibility) owned by
`ScalarField3D`, hidden by default, reading the field samples from its parent
(silx wires the data `copy=False` — one owner). `ScalarField3D::append_to`
intersects the plane with the volume box (`box_plane_intersect`) → the contour
polygon, rasterises the slice onto a `resolution × resolution` grid (CPU field
sampler matching silx's texture convention — voxel centre `(ix,iy,iz)` at world
`(ix+0.5,…)`, clamp-to-edge, nearest/trilinear), colours it through the colormap
(CPU `color_at`), and emits the fan-triangulated polygon as one textured mesh.
Documented simplifications: the slice is a 2D grid texture rather than silx's
per-fragment 3D-texture sampling, so sharpness is bounded by `resolution` (the
same CPU-colormap deviation as P1.1–P2.1). **Deferred (documented):** silx's
`ClipPlane` (`scene/primitives.py` `ClipPlane` — a scene-graph geometry-clipping
plane that sets a per-fragment `gl_ClipDistance`, cross-cutting every shader) is
not ported; it is not used by `ScalarField3D`'s cut plane and would require a
clip-distance uniform threaded through all 3D pipelines — a separate enhancement,
not part of the cut-plane flagship.

P2.1 notes: `marching_cubes` (`src/core/scene3d/marching_cubes.rs`) is a
line-for-line port of silx's C++ `mc.hpp` slice-by-slice algorithm + the verbatim
256-case lookup tables from `mc_lut.cpp` (Paul Bourke / Cory Bloyd, MIT), driven
the same way as `marchingcubes.pyx`. Output vertices/normals stay in
`(z,y,x)`/`(nz,ny,nx)` (silx's order); `sampling` and `invert_normals` are carried
through faithfully. `ScalarField3D`/`Isosurface` (`render::scene3d_items`) own the
`(depth,height,width)` field and its iso-surfaces: each surface is extracted with
marching cubes and emitted as a lit solid-colour mesh (P1.2 path), mapping the
`(z,y,x)` vertices to world `(x+0.5, y+0.5, z+0.5)` — silx's `_isogroup` swap
matrix + `Translate(0.5,0.5,0.5)`. Field bounds are the full volume box (silx
`BoundedGroup`). Auto-level (`mean_plus_std`, silx's documented default) re-resolves
on data change. Documented simplifications: the cut plane is P2.2; iso-surface
`_pickFull` (ray/marching-cubes-per-bin) is deferred with GPU picking; lighting
uses the baked-in viewport defaults (as P1.2).

### Phase 3 — tools / window / parity tail

| Wave | Item | silx source | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| P3.1 | Viewpoint presets (+ PositionInfo deferred-with-picking; GroupProperties → P3.2) | actions/viewpoint.py, tools/ViewpointTools.py | ◐ |
| P3.2 | 3D colorbar + egui parameter panel (+ GroupProperties) | tools/GroupProperties.py, _model/* (→ egui) | ☐ |
| P3.3 | SceneWindow composition + io snapshot + roadmap reconcile | SceneWindow.py, actions/io.py | ☐ |

P3.1 notes: ports silx's **viewpoint presets** in full. `SceneWidget::set_viewpoint`
mirrors `actions/viewpoint.py._SetViewpointAction` — `camera.extrinsic.reset(face)`
then `centerScene()` — for all seven faces (front/back/left/right/top/bottom/side,
the existing `CameraFace`); `SceneWidget::rotate_scene(angle_degrees)` ports
`RotateViewpoint`'s per-frame `viewport.orbitCamera("left", angle)` as a primitive
the caller animates. `viewpoint_menu` (`widget::scene_widget`) ports
`tools.ViewpointTools.ViewpointToolButton` — a "View" drop-down whose items invoke
the presets, verified end-to-end through an AccessKit harness click
(`tests/scene_viewpoint_render.rs`). **Deferred / relocated (documented, not
dropped):** `tools.PositionInfoWidget` is built entirely on
`SceneWidget.pickItems(x, y, …)` — 3D scene picking, which is deferred alongside
the iso-surface `_pickFull` GPU-picking work (see P2.1 notes); it cannot be ported
faithfully without that picker, so it stays deferred rather than stubbed with a
non-functional readout. The `GroupPropertiesWidget` properties panel is scoped with
the egui parameter panel in **P3.2** (its silx `tools/GroupProperties.py` +
`_model/*` source), so P3.1 stops at the viewpoint tools.

## Verification

Per the project's empirical pattern (no golden images): headless wgpu pixel
readback via `egui_kittest` for render correctness, plus pure-compute unit tests
for the math (camera/projection values vs silx, marching-cubes vs known cubes,
transform round-trips). Honest labels: render-verified, not pixel-compared to
silx's OpenGL output (different rasterizer).
